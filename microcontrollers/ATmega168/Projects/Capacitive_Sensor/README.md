# Capacitive Sensor


### Description

The following project represents usage of pin interrupt to make a simple
capacitive sensor. Program counts how many times capacitor charges and
discharges in a given time period, then based on this information program
decides whether there was any touch or hand next to the sensor, if yes
the LEDs are turned ON and desired message is sent over serial port to the
PC.
