# PWM LED Blink


### Description

The following project represents basic usage of Pulse Width Modulation (PWM),
that is based on timers.
The LEDs are brighten up, then dimmed, whole process is repeated infinitely.
The main drawback of this program is that it uses whole processor time, but it
is only for educational purposes, not commercial implementation.
