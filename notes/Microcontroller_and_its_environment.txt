Goals:
    - how to properly connect microcontroller to the voltage source
    - how to convert logic levels 
    - how to connect peripherals working in different voltage domains to I2C main line
    - how to properly connect external quartz


1. Power connection
   ================
   @Remember: If a microcontroller has a few GND/Vcc/AVcc pins, all of them must be connected
             to the power.

2. Decoupling capacitor
   ====================
   @Remember: Connect to every power pin decoupling capacitor to avoid unpredictable problems
             (capacitors should be placed as close pin's leg as possible).

             Use ceramic (not electrolytic) capacitors with low impedance.


3. Power filtering for analog part of the processor
   ================================================
   @Remember: If you want to measure ADC precisely, it is good to use LC filter in AVcc line.
             If not, it is not necessary, and AVcc can be treat as normal Vcc/GND line.


4. Logic levels conversion between peripherals working in different voltage domains
   ================================================================================
   AVR microcontrollers are able to work with wide range of voltages: 1.8V - 5.5V.
   It is good practice to adjust voltage level to the device with less flexible 
   voltage tolerance, AVR probably will be able to adjust to this level either.


5. Voltage vs frequency
   ====================
   General rule: The higher voltage, the higher frequency can be used.


6. IO pins
   =======
   Every pin can be set as input (default state) or output.
   Pin set as an input has a very high impedance (up to Mâ„¦), thanks to this it is safe to 
   connect signal in supply voltage range.
   
   @Remember: After processor reset, all of the IO pins are set as an input without pull-up 
              or pull-down to Vcc or GND. If such a pin will be left and not connected, 
              it will be in floating state (floats between high and low state).
              It is not favorable, because it consums more power and weaken its resistance
              to noises.

              AVR pins are able to handle voltage up to Vcc + 0.6V.
            

7. Voltage divider
   ===============
   Voltage dividers are often used in situation, when input voltage with high amplitude is 
   injected to the analog input of the processor, e.g. ADC input.


8. Clock oscillator
   ================
   All of the AVR are configured in this way, that they start with the interal clock generator (RC generator).
   The drawback of this RC generator is low stability. That is why, it is good to use external clock generator,
   mostly it is quartz oscillator, which is much more stable.

   @Remember: Connect capacitors to the external quartz oscillator, its capacitance ranges from 6-22 pF.

   To properly calculate appropriate capacitances for the quartz oscillator, you need to consider:
    - capacitances of input pins XTAL1 and XTAL2 (~4.44 pF)
    - capacitance of a exit/housing (~0.27 pF)
    - capacitance of lead traces (~1.00 pF)
        
    Sum of this capacitances (Cw) must be substracted from the 'load capacitance' of the quartz oscillator.
    
   @Formula: Ce = 2 * Cx - Cw      where:  Ce - outer capacitor value
                                           Cx - recommended 'load capacitance' (set by the vendor)
                                           Cw - sum of the XTAL1/2, exit/housing capacitances

   @Rules:
    - Do not provide any high frequency signals or high current traces near the quartz and capacitors
    - It is good to provide large mass (ground) field around the generator
    - Load capacitors should be placed as near quartz legs and the processor as possible
    - Load capacitors should be stable (NPO or COG)
    - Traces which connect quartz with XTAL1 and XTAL2 entries should be maximally apart from each other
