1. RAM - Random Access Memory
   ==========================
   Random Access Memory (RAM) is used because the CPU can access any block of memory in RAM in the same amount of time.
   This differs from sequential storage such as tape where access time differs for different parts of the storage space.
   RAM is used for data memory and allows the CPU to create and modify data as it executes the application program.
   RAM is volatile, it holds its contents onyl as long as it has constant power supply.


2. ROM - Read Only Memory
   ======================
   ROM is typically used for program instructions. The ROM in a microcontroller usually holds the final application program.


3. PROM - Programmable ROM
   =======================
   PROM started as an expensive means to prototype and test application code before burning ROM. Many developers use PROM
   devices to provide software updates to customers without the cost of sending out new hardware.


4. EPROM - Erasable Programmable ROM
   =================================
   EPORM is not volatile and is read only. Chips with EPROM have a quartz window on the chip. Direct exposure to ultra-violet
   radiation will erase the EPROM contents. The default, blank state for an EPROM device has each block of memory set (1).
   Reprogramming the device resets or clears the appropriate EPROM bits to 0. Because of the way EPROM storage is erased, 
   one cannot selectively delete portions of EPROM - erasing memory will clear the entire storage space.


5. EEPROM - Electrically Erasable Programmable ROM
   ===============================================
   EEPROM devices allow selective erasing of memory sections. They use high voltage to erase and re-program each memory block.
   The most common use for EEPROM is recording and maintaining configuration data vital to the application, eg. record the current
   configurations settings of the device. Often the default or factory configuration settings are stored in ROM and the user
   can issue a command to restore default settings by overwriting the current contents of EEPROM with the default information.


6. Flash Memory
   ============
   Flash memory is an economical compromise between EEPROM and EPROM techonology. As with EEPROM high voltage is applied to
   erase and rewrite flash memory. However, unlike EEPROM, one can not selectively erase portions of flash memory - the entire
   block as with EPROM devices must be erased.


7. Registers
   =========
   Registers are used to control program execution and maintain intermediate values needed to perform required calculations. 
   Usage of CPU register can be extremely dangerous, they value used for temporary storage can be overwritten at any time by the CPU.
   8-bit microcontrollers do not often provide resources for register memory outside the CPU, this means that the C 'register' keyword
   is meaningless because the compiler can not dedicate a CPU register for data storage.
   Some C implementations will set aside RAM for special purpose 'pseudo-registers' to use when your application attempts certain
   operations, for example 16-bit math operation.


8. Scratch Pad
   ===========
   Scratch Pad is a block of memory which can be used for more than one purpose.
