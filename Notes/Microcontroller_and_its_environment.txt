Goals:
    - how to properly connect microcontroller to the voltage source
    - how to convert logic levels 
    - how to connect peripherals working in different voltage domains to I2C main line
    - how to properly connect external quartz


1. Power connection
   ================
   Remember: If a microcontroller has a few GND/Vcc/AVcc pins, all of them must be connected
             to the power.

2. Decoupling capacitor
   ====================
   Remember: Connect to every power pin decoupling capacitor to avoid unpredictable problems
             (capacitors should be placed as close pin's leg as possible).

             Use ceramic (not electrolytic) capacitors with low impedance.


3. Power filtering for analog part of the processor
   ================================================
   Remember: If you want to measure ADC precisely, it is good to use LC filter in AVcc line.
             If not, it is not necessary, and AVcc can be treat as normal Vcc/GND line.
