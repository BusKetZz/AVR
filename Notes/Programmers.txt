GOALS:  
        - how to connect programmer with the microcontroller
        - how to solve the most common problems concerning programming
        - which programmer to choose


1. Connection - general rules
   ==========================
   Do not add any other peripherals to the processor-programmer connection lines, and if you must, they should not load heavily 
   the connection.
   If input port of the processor is connected to the output port of the programmer, do not add more output ports to this input
   port of the processor - there would be a conflict during programming a chip.

   @Remember: Connect all Vcc and GND pins to maintain stability.
              Connect GND of the programmer and processor together.


2. Most common problems
   ====================
   1) In the case of ISP programming - processor 'locking' through the inadequate fusebit configuration
   2) Incorrect frequency of the SCK signal (in the case of ISP programmers). The speed of the programming cannot be higher
      than 1/4 of the clock speed.
   3) Too long programmer-processor cable, it shoudl be 10-15cm long.
   4) Incorrect signals connection.
   5) Mismatched connection of the programmer to the SPI interface, not ISP.
   6) Improper choice of the programmer of programming mode.
   7) Blockade of the given interface.


3. ISP programmer
   ==============
   ISP - In-system Programming Interface

   pins: RESET, MISO, MOSI, SCK

   @Remember: Connect Vcc pin of the programmer to the power source of the programmable system. It is used to power the 
              level translators of the programmer.
              Always connect mass of the connected peripherals together.

   @Curio: Mass of the PC (its housing) has 115V potential relative to the ground.
